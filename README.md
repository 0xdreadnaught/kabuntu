# kabuntu
Deploy Kali type tools on Ubuntu 20.x
This is a work in progress. I will continue to update the script as I add more to the system.
The script could be much more efficient, but I've broken apart the packages so people can easily exclude things they don't want.

# Usage
Run the script as root, or with sudo.
chmod +x ./kabuntu.sh
./kabuntu

# Current Packages
